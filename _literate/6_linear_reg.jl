# This tutorial begins with a very provocative quote from the statistician
# [George Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box) (figure below)
# on statistical models. Yes, all models are somehow wrong. But they are very useful.
# The idea is that the reality is too complex for us to understand when analyzing it in
# a naked and raw way. We need to somehow simplify it into individual components and analyze
# their relationships. But there is a danger here: any simplification of reality promotes loss
# of information in some way. Therefore, we always have a delicate balance between simplifications
# of reality through models and the inherent loss of information. Now you ask me:
# "how are they useful?" Imagine that you are in total darkness and you have a very powerful
# flashlight but with a narrow beam. Are you going to throw the flashlight away because it
# can't light everything around you and stay in the dark? You must use the flashlight to aim
# at interesting places in the darkness in order to illuminate them. You will never find a
# flashlight that illuminates everything with the clarity you need to analyze all the fine details
# of reality. Just as you will never find a unique model that will explain the whole reality around
# you. You need different flashlights just like you need different models. Without them you will
# be in total darkness.
