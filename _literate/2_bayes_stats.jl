# # What is Bayesian Statistics?

# **Bayesian statistics** is an approach to inferential statistics based on Bayes' theorem, where available knowledge about
# parameters in a statistical model is updated with the information in observed data. The background knowledge is expressed
# as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior
# distribution. The posterior can also be used for making predictions about future events.

# **Bayesian statistics** is a departure from classical inferential statistics that prohibits probability statements about
# parameters and is based on asymptotically sampling infinite samples from a theoretical population and finding parameter values
# that maximize the likelihood function. Mostly notorious is null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) based on *p*-values.
# Bayesian statistics **incorporate uncertainty** (and prior knowledge) by allowing probability statements about parameters,
# and the process of parameter value inference is a direct result of the **Bayes' theorem**.

# Bayesian statistics is **revolutionizing all fields of evidence-based science**[^evidencebased] (van de Schoot et al. 2021).
# Dissatisfaction with traditional methods of statistical inference (frequentist statistics) and the advent of computers with exponential
# growth in computing power[^computingpower] provided a rise in Bayesian statistics because it is an approach aligned with the human
# intuition of uncertainty, robust to scientific malpractices, but computationally intensive.

# But before we get into Bayesian statistics, we have to talk about **probability**: the engine of Bayesian inference.

# ## What is Probability?

# > PROBABILITY DOES NOT EXIST!
# >
# > de Finetti (1974)[^deFinetti]

# These are the first words in the preface to the famous book by [Bruno de Finetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_de_Finetti)
# (figure below), one of the most important probability mathematician and philosopher.
# Yes, probability does not exist. Or rather, probability as a physical quantity, objective chance, **does NOT exist**.
# De Finetti showed that, in a precise sense, if we dispense with the question of objective chance *nothing is lost*.
# The mathematics of inductive reasoning remains **exactly the same**.

# ![De Finetti](/pages/images/finetti.jpg)
#
# \center{*Bruno de Finetti*} \\

# Consider tossing a weighted coin. The attempts are considered independent and, as a result, exhibit another
# important property: **the order does not matter**. To say that order does not matter is to say that if you take any
# finite sequence of heads and tails and exchange the results however you want,
# the resulting sequence will have the same probability. We say that this probability is
# **invariant under permutations**.

# Or, to put it another way, the only thing that matters is the relative frequency.
# Result that have the same frequency of heads and tails consequently have the same probability.
# The frequency is considered a **sufficient statistic**. Saying that order doesn't matter or saying
# that the only thing that matters is frequency are two ways of saying exactly the same thing.
# This property is called **exchangeability** by de Finetti. And it is the most important property of
# probability that makes it possible for us to manipulate it mathematically (or philosophically) even
# if it does not exist as a physical "thing".

# Still developing the argument:
# > "Probabilistic reasoning - always understood as subjective - stems
# > merely stems from our being uncertain about something. It makes no difference whether the uncertainty
# > relates to an unforeseeable future [^subjective], or to an unnoticed past, or to a past doubtfully reported
# > or forgotten [^objective]... The only relevant thing is uncertainty - the extent of our own knowledge and ignorance.
# > The actual fact of whether or not the events considered are in some sense determined, or known by other people,
# > and so on, is of no consequence." (de Finetti, 1974)

# In conclusion: no matter what the probability is, you can use it anyway, even if it is an absolute frequency
# (ex: probability that I will ride by bike naked is ZERO because the probability that an event that never occurred
# will occur in the future it is ZERO) or a subjective guess (ex: maybe the probability is not ZERO, but 0.00000000000001;
# very unlikely, but not impossible).

# ### Mathematical Definition

# With the philosophical intuition of probability elaborated, we move on to **mathematical intuitions**.
# The probability of an event is a real number[^realnumber], $\in \mathbb{R}$ between 0 and 1, where, roughly,
# 0 indicates the impossibility of the event and 1 indicates the certainty of the event. The greater the likelihood of an event,
# the more likely it is that the event will occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (impartial) coin. Since the coin is fair,
# both results ("heads" and "tails") are equally likely; the probability of "heads" is equal to the probability of "tails";
#  and since no other result is possible[^mutually], the probability of "heads" or "tails" is $\frac{1}{2}$
# (which can also be written as 0.5 or 50%).

# Regarding notation, we define $A$ as an event and $P(A)$ as the probability of event $A$, thus:

# $$\{P(A) \in \mathbb{R} : 0 \geq P(A) \geq 1 \}.$$

# This means the "probability of the event to occur is the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1; including 0 and 1".
# In addition, we have three axioms[^axioms], originated from Kolmogorov(1933) (figure below):

# 1. **Non-negativity**: For all $A$, $P(A) \geq 0$. Every probability is positive (greater than or equal to zero), regardless of the event.
# 2. **Additivity**: For two mutually exclusive $A$ and $B$ (cannot occur at the same time[^mutually2]): $P(A) = 1 - P(B)$ and $P(B) = 1 - P(A)$.
# 3. **Normalization**: The probability of all possible events $A_1, A_2, \ dots$ must add up to 1: $\sum_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_n = 1$.

# ![Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov](/pages/images/kolmogorov.jpg)
#
# \center{*Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov*} \\

# With these three simple (and intuitive) axioms, we are able to **derive and construct all the mathematics of probability**.

# ### Conditional Probability

# An important concept is the **conditional probability** that we can define as the "probability that one event will occur if another
# has occurred or not". The notation we use is $ P(A \mid B)$, which reads as "the probability that we have observed $A$ given
# we have already observed $B$".

# A good example is the [Texas Hold'em Poker game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em),
# where the player receives two cards and can use five "community cards" to set up
# his "hand". The probability that you are dealt a King ($K$) is $\frac{4}{52}$:

# $$ P(K) = \left(\frac{4}{52}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{13}\right) \label{king} . $$

# And the probability of being dealt an Ace is also the same as \eqref{king}, $\frac{4}{52}$:

# $$ P(A) = \left(\frac{4}{52}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{13}\right) \label{ace} . $$

# However, the probability that you are dealt a King as a second card since you have been dealt an Ace as a first card is:

# $$ P(K \mid A) = \left(\frac{4}{51}\right) \label{kingace} . $$

# Since we have one less card ($52 - 1 = 51$) because you have been dealt already an Ace (thus $A$ has been observed),
# we have 4 Kings still in the deck, so the \eqref{kingace} is $\frac{4}{51}$.

# ### Joint Probability

# Conditional probability leads us to another important concept: joint probability. **Joint probability
# is the "probability that two events will both occur"**. Continuing with our Poker example, the probability
# that you will receive two Ace cards ($A$) and a King ($K$) as two starting cards is:

# $$
# \begin{aligned}
# P(A,K) &= P(A) \cdot P(K \mid A) \label{aceandking}\\
# &= P \left(\frac{1}{13}\right) \cdot P \left(\frac{4}{51}\right)\\
# &= P \left(\frac{4}{51 \cdot 13}\right) \\
# &\approx 0.006 .
# \end{aligned}
# $$

# Note that $P(A,K) = P(K,A)$:

# $$
# \begin{aligned}
# P(K,A) &= P(K) \cdot P(A \mid K) \label{kingandace}\\
# &= P \left(\frac{1}{13}\right) \cdot P \left(\frac{4}{51}\right)\\
# &= P \left(\frac{4}{51 \cdot 13}\right) \\
# &\approx 0.006 .
# \end{aligned}
# $$

# But this symmetry does not always exist (in fact it very rarely exists). The identity we have is as follows:

# $$ P(A) \cdot P(K \mid A) = P(K) \cdot P(A \mid K) . $$

# So this symmetry only exists when the baseline rates for conditional events are equal:

# $$ P(A) = P(K). $$

# Which is what happens in our example.

# #### Conditional Probability is not "commutative"

# $$ P(A \mid B) \neq P(B \mid A) \label{noncommutative} $$

# Let's see a practical example. For example, Iâ€™m feeling good and start coughing in line at the supermarket.
# What do you think will happen? Everyone will think I have COVID, which is equivalent to thinking about
# $P(\text{cough} \mid \text{covid})$. Seeing the most common symptoms of COVID, **if you have COVID, the chance of
# coughing is very high**. But we actually cough a lot more often than we have COVID -- $P(\text{cough}) \neq P(\text{COVID})$, so:

# $$ P(\text{COVID} \mid \text{cough}) \neq P(\text{cough} \mid \text{COVID}) . $$

# ### Bayes' Theorem

# This is the last concept of probability that we need to address before diving into Bayesian statistics,
# but it is the most important. Note that it is not a semantic coincidence that Bayesian statistics and Bayes' theorem
# have the same prefix.

# [Thomas Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes) (1701 - 1761, figure below) was an English Presbyterian statistician,
# philosopher and minister known for formulating a specific case of the theorem that bears his name: Bayes' theorem.
# Bayes never published what would become his most famous accomplishment; his notes were edited and published
# after his death by his friend Richard Price[^thomaspricelaplace]. In his later years, Bayes was deeply interested in probability.
# Some speculate that he was motivated to refute David Hume's argument against belief in miracles based on evidence from the testimony in "An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding".

# ![Thomas Bayes](/pages/images/thomas_bayes.gif)
#
# \center{*Thomas Bayes*} \\

# Let's move on to Theorem. Remember that we have the following identity in probability:

# $$
# \begin{aligned}
# P(A,B) &= P(B,A) \\
# P(A) \cdot P(B \mid A) &= P(B) \cdot P(A \mid B) \label{jointidentity} .
# \end{aligned}
# $$

# Ok, now move $P(B)$ in the right of \eqref{jointidentity} to the left as a division:

# $$
# \begin{aligned}
# P(A) \cdot P(B \mid A) &= \overbrace{P(B)}^{\text{this goes to $\leftarrow$}} \cdot P(A \mid B) \\
# &\\
# \frac{P(A) \cdot P(B \mid A)}{P(B)} &= P(A \mid B) \\
# P(A \mid B) &= \frac{P(A) \cdot P(B \mid A)}{P(B)}.
# \end{aligned}
# $$

# And the final result is:

# $$ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A) \cdot P(B \mid A)}{P(B)}. $$

# Bayesian statistics uses this theorem as **inference engine** of **parameters** of a model
# **conditioned** on **observed data**.

# ### Discrete vs Continuous Parameters

# Everything that has been exposed so far is based on the assumption that the parameters are discrete.
# This was done in order to provide a better intuition of what is probability. We do not always work with discrete parameters.
# The parameters can be continuous, for example: age, height, weight, etc. But don't despair, all the rules and axioms of
# probability are also valid for continuous parameters. The only thing we have to do is to exchange all the sums $\sum$
# for integrals $\int$. For example, the third axiom of **Normalization** for continuous random variables becomes:

# $$ \int_{x \in X} p(x) dx = 1 . $$

# ## Bayesian Statistics

# Now that you know what probability is and what Bayes' theorem is, I will propose the following model:

# $$
# \underbrace{P(\theta \mid y)}_{\text{Posterior}} = \frac{\overbrace{P(y \mid  \theta)}^{\text{Likelihood}} \cdot \overbrace{P(\theta)}^{\text{Prior}}}{\underbrace{P(y)}_{\text{Normalizing Constant}}} \label{bayesianstats} ,
# $$

# where:

# * $\theta$ -- parameter(s) of interest;
# * $y$ -- observed data;
# * **Prior** -- previous probability of the parameter(s) value(s)[^prior] $\theta$;
# * **Likelihood** -- probability of the observed data $y$ conditioned on the parameter(s) value(s) $\theta$;
# * **Posterior** -- posterior probability of the parameter(s) value(s) $\theta$ after observing the data $y$; and
# * **Normalizing Constant ** -- $P(y)$ does not make intuitive sense. This probability is transformed and can be interpreted as something that exists only so that the result of $P(y \mid \theta) P(\theta)$ is somewhere between 0 and 1 -- a valid probability by the axioms. We will talk more about this constant in [5. **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**](/pages/5_MCMC/).

# Bayesian statistics allow us **to directly quantify the uncertainty** related to the value of one or more parameters of our model
# conditioned to the observed data. This is the **main feature** of Bayesian statistics, for we are directly estimating
# $P (\theta \mid y)$ using Bayes' theorem. The resulting estimate is totally intuitive: it simply quantifies the uncertainty
# we have about the value of one or more parameters conditioned on the data, the assumptions of our model (likelihood) and
# the previous probability(prior) we have about such values.

# ## Frequentist Statistics

# To contrast with Bayesian statistics, let's look at the frequentist statistics, also known as "classical statistics".
# And already take notice: **it is not something intuitive** like the Bayesian statistics.

# ## Footnotes
#
# [^evidencebased]: personally, like a good Popperian, I don't believe there is science without being evidence-based; what does not use evidence can be considered as logic, philosophy or social practices (no less or more important than science, just a demarcation of what is science and what is not; eg, mathematics and law).
# [^computingpower]: your smartphone (iPhone 12 - 4GB RAM) has 1,000,000x (1 million) more computing power than the computer that was aboard the Apollo 11 (4kB RAM) which took the man to the moon. Detail: this on-board computer was responsible for lunar module navigation, route and controls.
# [^deFinetti]: if the reader wants an in-depth discussion see Nau (2001).
# [^subjective]: my observation: related to the subjective Bayesian approach.
# [^objective]: my observation: related to the objective frequentist approach.
# [^realnumber]: a number that can be expressed as a point on a continuous line that originates from minus infinity and ends and plus infinity $(-\infty, +\infty)$; for those who like computing it is a floating point `float` or` double`.
# [^mutually]: i.e the events are "mutually exclusive".
# [^axioms]: in mathematics, axioms are assumptions assumed to be true that serve as premises or starting points for the elaboration of arguments and theorems. Often the axioms are questionable, for example non-Euclidean geometry refutes Euclid's fifth axiom on parallel lines. So far there is no questioning that has supported the scrutiny of time and science about the three axioms of probability.
# [^mutually2]: for example, the result of a given coin is one of two mutually exclusive events: heads or tails.
# [^thomaspricelaplace]: the formal name of the theorem is Bayes-Price-Laplace, as Thomas Bayes was the first to discover, Richard Price took his drafts, formalized in mathematical notation and presented to the Royal Society of London, and Pierre Laplace rediscovered the theorem without having had previous contact in the late 18th century in France by using probability for statistical inference with Census data in the Napoleonic era.
# [^prior]: I will cover prior probabilities in the content of tutorial [4. **How to use Turing**](/pages/4_Turing/).
